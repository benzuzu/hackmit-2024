    "A tall, muscular warrior named Aria with long, wavy silver hair and piercing blue eyes. She has a scar running down her right cheek, and her skin is a fair, almost pale tone. Aria wears a suit of medieval silver armor engraved with intricate runes, and a blue cape flowing behind her. She stands confidently with a hand resting on the hilt of her sword, her face set in a determined but calm expression. Her eyes gleam with intelligence and courage. Around her neck is a small silver pendant shaped like a hawk. Her boots are sturdy leather, worn from years of battle, and she carries a shield emblazoned with a dragon emblem.";

  const character2 =
    "Talon is a tall, lean man standing at 6'2\", with a wiry yet muscular build. His skin is a light tan, with a faint scar running across his left eyebrow. He has a sharp, angular face, framed by short, messy black hair swept back. His deep-set grey eyes are piercing and constantly scanning with a calculating, cold intensity. His nose is narrow and slightly crooked from an old break, and his lips are thin, giving him a stern expression. A jagged scar cuts across his jawline, adding to his dangerous appearance. Talon wears a black leather hooded cloak down to his knees, blending seamlessly with his dark, close-fitting armor made of matte black leather with silver accents. Across his chest are several small, silver throwing knives in an X-shape. He carries twin daggers with intricately carved obsidian hilts, and a pouch at his belt holds poison vials. His black, soft-soled boots are strapped tightly around his calves, and a single leather glove covers his left hand. He stands relaxed yet ready, with a slight smirk of confidence. The colors of his outfit are black and silver, with crimson accents on his daggers. Behind him are dark alleyways of a medieval city, cloaked in shadows, where he thrives as an assassin.";
